# Onboard training users and data on existing cluster

The playbook `playbook/training-setup.yml` is responsible for
* creating user accounts
* uploaded trainig datasets in HDFS and creating training Hive tables
* install necessary client Linux libraries on the edge
It runs all above activities on the `edge` node.
It can also onboard HUE users (by executing the `hue-users` role) - make sure that `hosts` points to the node that has HUE installed (e.g. edge or master)
